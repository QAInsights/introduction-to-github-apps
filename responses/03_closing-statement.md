Look at that! Both the reminder App and the WIP App stayed silent, even though you took an action. Remember, webhooks are security cameras designed to look into a specific place. Wenhooks will only take triggered if the specifc pre-defined event occurs, otherwise, nothing happens. 

The only reason I know this happened is because I was looking for you to close the issue!

:tada: Surprise! I've been an App this whole time :smile:. I know, I know. I didn't fool you. 

Prompt: For your last step, ask the reminder application to remind you to come back in a month and do another course! I'd love to teach you even more about Apps, including how to build one! Our next course should be published in a month.
