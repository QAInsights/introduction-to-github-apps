APIs and Webhooks go hand in hand, but the distinction between them is important.

- Webhooks are specific "noise" interpreters. They wait for events to act as their trigger.
- The GitHub API actually makes changes to the platform once it has been notified by the webhook. Knowing both the GitHub API and GitHub's webhooks will give you the needed context to later customize the platform for your needs.
