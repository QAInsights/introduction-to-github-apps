## Extending webhooks

The next GitHub App we're going to install is called [**Request Info**](https://probot.github.io/apps/request-info/).  By following the link, you can see images that teach you how this new app works.

As you install, try to think about which webhook events will activate when we test this out. Just like we did with the WIP app, make sure to install this app on this repository only. Don't apply it to everything you have access to.
