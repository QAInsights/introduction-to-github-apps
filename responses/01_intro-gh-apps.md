# Welcome to Getting started with GitHub Apps

Before we start using real GitHub applications, let's get some foundations out of the way.

### New to GitHub?

For this course, you'll need to know how to create a branch on GitHub, commit changes using Git, and open a pull request on GitHub. If you need a refresher on the GitHub flow, check out the [the Introduction to GitHub course]({{ host}}/courses/introduction-to-github).

## Application vs GitHub Application
There are many types of applications, like the apps you might have on your phone. In this course, we'll focus on **GitHub Applications**, apps designed to work on GitHub.

GitHub Apps allow you to change GitHub's surface-level functionality. With webhooks and GitHub's APIs, GitHub Apps act as top-layer tools that you can use to customize and automate routine processes.

## Installing a GitHub App

To learn more about GitHub Apps, let's install two to this repository. Make sure to install the apps on **this** repository only. Don't apply them to everything you have access to.

1) **[WIP Probot app](https://probot.github.io/apps/wip/)** "WIP" is a common abbreviation to mean **work in progress**
2) [**Request Info**](https://probot.github.io/apps/request-info/)

After you install these apps, close this issue out. That way, I'll know you've completed your task and are ready to tackle this course.
