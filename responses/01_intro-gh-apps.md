Hey! I'm _so_ excited you're here to learn about GitHub Apps! Who doesn't like talking about themselves? :wink:

First, let's quickly get some foundations out of the way and then apply that knowledge using some real GitHub applications. See if you can answer the questions below :point_down:. If you need help, feel free to expand the dropdown next to each question to see relevant information.

### Starter questions

<details><summary>What's an app(lication)?</summary>

In this context, apps are software with a bunch of functionality whose purpose is to make your life easier.

The dictionary calls an application "a formal request to an authority for something," which can also be true in software. When you request a service do something, you're appealing to a greater authority and hoping that it works.

When it doesn't, there's always Twitter. But not in my case! Here, we've got something called the Community Forum. You should leave your concerns there and my human minions will help you fix any issues.

<details><summary>Why would people use it?</summary>

As humans, we're constantly generating data. Photos, text, financial transactions, etc. In your everyday life, you use a ton of software applications to help you create, manage, and sort through all of this data. You might use an e-mail client to compile and **style** your thoughts, a social platform to share and view photos and news, or mobile application to respond to immediate alerts like a social invitation out (your message application) or a financial notification.

Depending on your circumstances, it's likely that your life is just a series of interactions between one application, to another, to another, until you go to bed and use an application to help you wake up in the morning (alarm software) and do it all again.

Really bleak, if you think about it. We should probably all exercise more so we can get away from all this... while listening to music through an application and having our workout tracked so we can monitor ourselves and make sure we're healthy.

... there's no escaping this.

</details>

<details><summary>How does this work on GitHub?</summary>

GitHub **is** an app. It comes with a ton of built in functionality to help you manage your work and collaborate. We're hiding processes behind the scenes to help you focus on what's important: your code. And we're consistently releasing new features to make sharing easier.

GitHub Apps allow you to change GitHub's surface-level functionality to automate core actions based on specific behaviors. Whether this is to abstract repetitive processes away, ensure a baseline of behavior, increase community involvement and understanding, or something entirely unexplored, you can change GitHub's default processes to add your own value.

<details><summary>I still don't get the difference</summary>

It's sometimes helpful to use a metaphor when understanding new concepts. For this concept, picture an iceberg.

![Iceberg](https://media.istockphoto.com/photos/iceberg-picture-id452595535?k=6&m=452595535&s=612x612&w=0&h=uHzj5baAAZH4osCYXBY5JNRrim-aCqG6TxzQPxAiRrc=)

The iceberg is a GitHub repository.

Much of GitHub's magic is happening under the surface. We're hosting and scaling code and communication, creating and connecting tunnels between you and your favorite integrations, and regularly adding features to the surface to improve your workflow.

Imagine examining this surface every day, and performing the same behaviors. Maybe you need to walk across Iceberg Island™️ every morning to make sure the ice hasn't melted. What if you could use a snowmobile to do that in a fraction of the time? Maybe one day your coworker accidentally arrives to your island with a flamethrower. Flamethrowers are illegal on Iceberg Island™️... obviously. What if you could create a security checkpoint to make sure that dangerous objects are never permitted?

Everyone works differently. Not every island will need a snowmobile, or a security checkpoint. Some might need entirely different tools because they are exploring entirely different research projects.

Many people will continue to explore and build their islands without any extra tools to help them. But those people haven't discovered GitHub Apps.

GitHub Apps are top-layer tools that you can use (and build) to make your regular and repetitive processes easier.

We'll look at some real examples very soon in this course.
