# Welcome to the Introduction to GitHub Apps course

Before we start using real GitHub applications, let's get some foundations out of the way.

Note: this course assumes that you've previously completed the ["Introduction to GitHub"](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/introduction-to-github) Learning Lab course.

## Application vs GitHub Application
There are many types of applications, like the apps you might have on your phone. In this course, we'll focus on **GitHub Applications**, apps designed to work on GitHub.

GitHub Apps allow you to change GitHub's surface-level functionality. With webhooks and GitHub's APIs, GitHub Apps act as top-layer tools that you can use to customize and automate routine processes.

## Installing a GitHub App

To learn more about GitHub Apps, let's install the **[WIP Probot App](https://probot.github.io/apps/wip/)** to this repository. "WIP" is a common abbreviation to mean **work in progress**. Make sure to install this app on this repo only. Don't apply it to everything you have access to.

GitHub Apps are not people. You can't interact with them by doing things like using an @mention, or assigning them to review your work.

Try it out! After you install the WIP app, try and assign myself or the WIP app to this PR. If you can't, assign yourself so I know you're ready to get started.
