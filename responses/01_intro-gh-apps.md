# Welcome to the Introduction to GitHub Apps course

Before we start using real GitHub applications, let's get some foundations out of the way. 

Note: this course assumes that you've previously completed the ["Introduction to GitHub"](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/introduction-to-github) Learning Lab course.

## Application vs GitHub Application
There are many types of applications, like the apps you might have on your phone. In this course, we'll focus on **GitHub Applications**, apps designed to work on GitHub.

GitHub Apps allow you to change GitHub's surface-level functionality. With webhooks and GitHub's APIs, GitHub Apps act as top-layer tools that you can use to customize and automate routine processes. 

## Installing a GitHub App

[Probot](https://probot.github.io/) is the basis of some of the coolest GitHub Apps out there. Most [Probot apps](https://probot.github.io/docs/) are already hosted, easy to install, and easy to discover. [Probot is a framework](https://probot.github.io/docs/) to help you build GitHub Apps while using Node.js.

Here are a few examples of things built with Probot:
- **[Stale](https://probot.github.io/apps/stale/)**: Closes issues and PRs that have been around for a bit too long without activity
- **[Delete merged branch](https://probot.github.io/apps/delete-merged-branch/)**: After a merge, deletes the branch
- **[First timers](https://probot.github.io/apps/first-timers/)**: Creates an issue to help onboard new open source contributors to your community

To learn more about GitHub Apps, let's install the **[WIP Probot App](https://probot.github.io/apps/wip/)** to this repository. Make sure to install this app on this repo only. Don't apply it to everything you have access to.
