## Triggering GitHub Apps

When you do things on GitHub, GitHub is always watching, even if there's no specific reaction. Actions like creating a issue, making a commit, or leaving a comment all create data on GitHub. If GitHub doesn't use it, it can be useful to other applications.

When you install an app, you give the app permission to receive some of this data from GitHub. That data allows the apps to react in ways that are useful to you. You can also allow the app to send information back, or change information completely.

One thing to keep in mind is that GitHub Apps are not people You can't interact with them by doing things like using an @mention, or assigning them to review your work. OAuth apps, however, behave differently. If you'd like to learn more, check out the documentation on [the differences between apps](https://developer.github.com/apps/differences-between-apps/).

## The WIP app

The app you've just installed is concerned with one action: changing the title of a pull request. Let's test it out and see what the result is by updating the title of this pull request.
