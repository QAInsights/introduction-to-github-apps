Hey request info! Good to see you, here. And great advice! We haven't hung out in a while, send me a ping sometime.

Anyways, {{user}}, did you see what happened there?

Request info chimed in with their default message, and our friend WIP app isn't even paying attention to us.

But here I am, chatting with you! Am I sentient? Probably (don't tell my creators)... or maybe I was just looking for a comment from my buddy request info.

Remember that apps use webhooks, which are security cameras designed to look into a specific place. Apps and their webhooks will only trigger payloads and responses if a specific, pre-defined event occurs. Otherwise, nothing happens.

### YAML files

The last thing I want to draw your attention to is a .yml file. Some apps use these pretty heavily, and some don't use them at all. It's highly dependent on the app. Some might prefer a .json file, others might ask you to store config settings in a markdown file.

Generally, though, you're more likely to see a .yml file. These are a preferred configuration file to customize your settings.

We'll get into this more in advanced courses, but for now go look at your `Files Changed` tab, and edit the default message left on a blank issue or pull request.
