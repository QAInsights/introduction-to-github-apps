## Request Info app
When a user opens an empty issue or pull request, the Request Info app will do exactly that -- request some more information.

You can see that request info has already responded to this pull request with a default message.

## Configuration files
Per the app installation instructions, this app requires a `.github/config.yml` file for it to respond with a default message. I've already included that in this pull request for you. Some apps use these, and some don't use them at all. Some apps might use a `.json` file, while others might ask you to store configuration settings in a `.md` file.

This allows you to take default templates and extend them to your own projects.

## Step 8: Configure apps

Let's use your default template to learn about APIs. First, make a simple change to the standard message.
