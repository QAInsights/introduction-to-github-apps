Some of the coolest GitHub Apps out there were made with [Probot](https://probot.github.io/). Don't worry, we'll learn more about Probot later. For now, know that most [Probot apps](https://probot.github.io/docs/) are already hosted, easy to install, and easy to discover. That means that there is nothing for you to deploy and manage when using these Probot Apps! Pretty nice, huh. 

Here are just a few examples of things that have been built with Probot:

- [Stale](https://probot.github.io/apps/stale/), which closes issues and PRs that have been around for just a bit too long without activity.
- [Delete merged branch](https://probot.github.io/apps/delete-merged-branch/), so that you don't have to remember to do this after a merge.
- [First timers](https://probot.github.io/apps/first-timers/), which creates a starter issue to help you onboard new open source contributors to your community.

Like I said, there are a lot of really cool Apps out there! 

We're going to start by installing the [WIP Probot App](https://probot.github.io/apps/wip/). Make sure to install this app on this repo only, don't apply it to everything you have access to.

### :keyboard: Activity: Install a Probot App

1. Install the [WIP app](https://probot.github.io/apps/wip/) to this repository.
</br>:warning: Again, don't install on ALL of your repositories unless you want it on all of your repositories. For this activity, we advise you just install it on this repo only.
