Last up, I want to break down the different things an App needs to survive. You know, like :poultry_leg:, :droplet:, and :house: ... just kidding. To better understand the things an App needs to function properly, it's time for another metaphor :smile:

### Home Security System

An App is like a home security system. It's equipped to watch your house at all times, but only notifies you for specific criteria.

**When you install a home security system, you need to worry about a few components:**
- Electricity (it needs to have the power to run continuously. You don't want failure when you aren't watching)
- Standard behaviors (you want the system know the mechanisms for movement detection, noise, and doors opening. You don't want to have to program it to understand these actions -- you want to select how it responds to actions).
- Location (think about what you want to watch, and where you'll go to view the reports of what you're watching -- is this an app on your phone that keeps a log? What does that look like?)

**Every GitHub App needs:**
- A place to call home (deployment)
- Defined patterns so that it can look for specific behaviors, like "closing an issue", or "assigning yourself to this issue"
- A monitoring system, to make sure it's free of bugs and behaving appropriately.

Next up, let's look at a real live GitHub App! Close this issue and I'll meet you in a pull request so that we can experiment.
