| GHES must be able to reach githubusercontent.com                                                                         | Yes       | Images used throughout the course are served from this domain. Learners will find broken images required to take the course without this access. | Manually download the images referenced in the `responses/` folder, upload them to an accessible domain, and replace the images in the `responses/` folder.                                    |
| Learner must be able to reach github.com and outside web                                                                 | No        | Links are provided to resources that live on the outside web.                                                                                    | Without access to resources on the outside web, learners will reach blocked resources. You can change the links to these resources in the `responses/` folder, and in the template repository. |
| The [WIP App](https://github.com/apps/wip) must be installed or approved for installation. | No        | Used in a course step to teach learners how to mark a pull request as a work-in-progress.                                                                        | If the app won't be installed or pre-approved, remove the WIP step in `config.yml`, the step that follows it, and any references to the GitHub App in the `responses/` folder.     |
| The [Request info App](https://github.com/apps/request-info) must be installed or approved for installation. | No        | Used in a course step to show learners an app that can request more info on issues and pull requests.                                                                        | If the app won't be installed or pre-approved, remove the request info step in `config.yml`, the step that follows it, and any references to the GitHub App in the `responses/` folder.     |
| The GHE instance must be able to deliver and receive webhooks from [smee.io ](https://github.com/probot/smee.io). | No        | Used as a webhook payload delivery service.                                                                        | If the GHE instance can't deliver and receive webhooks from smee.io, the alternative is to provide some other tool to inspect webhook payloads and update any related content in the `responses/` folder.     |
