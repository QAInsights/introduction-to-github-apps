Have you ever wanted to add your own feature to GitHub, or automate repetitive tasks?

Say hello to GitHub Apps! GitHub Apps allow you to build custom workflows on top of GitHub's API. They can be installed directly on organizations and user accounts, and then granted access to specific repositories. This course will show you how automation can improve your workflow and reduce friction within your project.

After completing this course, youâ€™ll be able to:

- Install GitHub Apps
- Find other GitHub and OAuth Apps to improve your workflow
- Configure GitHub Apps to fit your needs

This course has a dedicated message board on the [GitHub Community]({{ communityBoard }}) website. If you want to discuss this course with GitHub Trainers or other participants create a post over there. The message board can also be used to troubleshoot any issue you encounter while taking this course.
