Have you ever wanted to add your own feature to GitHub? Or to automate workflows to avoid repetitive tasks?

Say hello to GitHub Apps! GitHub Apps allow you to build custom workflows with GitHub’s REST and GraphQL APIs. They can be installed directly on organizations and user accounts, and then granted access to specific repositories. This course will show you how automation can improve your workflow and reduce friction within your project.

After completing this course, you’ll be able to:

- navigate the GitHub API
- use GitHub webhooks
- describe GitHub Apps: their structure, use, and place in the development ecosystem
- install a Probot app onto your repository

This course has a dedicated message board on the [GitHub Community]({{ communityBoard }}) website. If you want to discuss this course with GitHub Trainers or other participants create a post over there. The message board can also be used to troubleshoot any issue you encounter while taking this course.
