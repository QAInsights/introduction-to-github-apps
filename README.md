Have you ever wanted to add your own feature to GitHub, or automate repetitive tasks?

Say hello to GitHub Apps! GitHub Apps allow you to build custom workflows on top of GitHub's API. They can be installed directly on organizations and user accounts, and then granted access to specific repositories. This course will show you how automation can improve your workflow and reduce friction within your project.

After completing this course, youâ€™ll be able to:

- describe GitHub Apps: their structure, use, and place in the development ecosystem
- install a Probot app onto your repository
- define a webhook
- define an API
- explain how events are triggered from actions taken on GitHub
- describe how an app consumes and acts on information from a webhook
- describe how to customize a default application behavior using a config.yml file

This course has a dedicated message board on the [GitHub Community]({{ communityBoard }}) website. If you want to discuss this course with GitHub Trainers or other participants create a post over there. The message board can also be used to troubleshoot any issue you encounter while taking this course.
